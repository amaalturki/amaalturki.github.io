### Project Focus

I’ll complete two separate microprojects. The first involves creating statistical visualizations of FIFA matches using historical data from over 150 years. The second focuses on developing an  algorithm to recognize video scenes that will be able to predict the classification of unknown future data, exploring image classification and basic computer vision techniques.

### Why This Project 

I chose this project because I love soccer and am excited to explore its rich historical data. The second project is important because it shows how AI can classify and predict scenes from video data, which is a technique widely used in topics that interest me, like surveillance, media analysis, and autonomous systems.

### What I Want to Learn

For my FIFA data visualization project and scene recognition model, I would like to improve my understanding of data structures, including lists and dictionaries, and how to analyze data using loops and conditionals. I would also like to create reusable functions that perform fixed actions. I am hoping to improve my skills in debugging, problem solving, design, and perseverance.


### My Approach 

[How do you plan to structure your time over the next two weeks? What will you focus on first? What will you prioritize later?  
What does “done enough” look like to you—and how will you decide when to stop polishing?]
By the weekend of 5/17-18, I plan to finish the project of creating statistical visualizations of FIFA matches, and by the week after that, on 5/24-25, I plan to finish my scene recognition microproject. My goal is to finish both projects with at least semi-functionality. For the FIFA matches project, which could only produce a limited type of data visualization, and for my scene recognition project, this level of semi-functionality means that it can only recognize scenes from certain types of video frames.

### What's Next

[What do you plan to tackle in the next stage of your project?]
I plan to begin working on my FIFA data visualization project. I will do this by watching the video walkthrough provided in the website.
