### What I Set Out to Do
To begin working on my data science microproject, I planned to complete the first Discovery module about the basics of data science with Python. This background knowledge was necessary to familiarize myself with the video walkthrough provided on UIUC's Discovery site and how to complete the microproject.

### What I Actually Did

I completed Module 1 of the Basics of Data Science with Python on UIUC's Discovery site. I read multiple lessons and watches lectures and videos to build my knowledge in data science.

### What I Learned or Noticed


I learned a lot from the data science module I completed. I learned about foundational concepts in data science, how data is structured, experimental design and cofounders, blocking, stratification, observational studies, the syntax to load datasets and row selection, using conditionals to get certain rows of a data frame, and software version control with git. All of this foundational knowledge is important for me to achieve this microproject.

### What's Next

Now that I have finished Module 1, I have the necessary knowledge to begin working on my microproject's Python notebook.
