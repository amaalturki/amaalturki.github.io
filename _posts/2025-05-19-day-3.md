### What I Set Out to Do
On this day of my project, I planned to complete the microproject about making data visualizations of FIFA international matches.

### What I Actually Did

I completed the microproject about making data visualizations of FIFA international matches. I created a bar graph highlighting the total number of goals scored by each country and a line plot showing the average number of goals scored per match throughout every World Cup.

### What I Learned or Noticed


I learned a variety of things while completing the Python notebook for this microproject. This includes grouping data to group each home team instance of a certain country into one row, and aggregating the number of home goals they scored to find the number home and away goals scored by each country. I also learned how to quickly make a bar graph and line plot using the matplot library. The results of those visualizations taught me that England is the highest-scoring country, with about 2500 goals in total, and that the average number of goals scored per match in each World Cup has declined.

### What's Next

Now that I have finished my first microproject about FIFA matches data, I can work on my second microproject about making a model that identifies images trained on a sample of video frames.
