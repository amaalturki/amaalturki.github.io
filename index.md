## About Me

Hi, I'm Abdurrahman, a student interested in math and science.  
This project was part of my final quest in Programming Fundamentals, and it reflects what I’ve learned about Python.

## About My Projects

**Project Titles:** *FIFA Matches Data Analysis* & *AI Scene Recognition Model*
**Pitch:** My first microproject analyzes data and statistics from over 45,000 FIFA matches since 1872, while my second microproject is an AI model that classifies scenes from video frames.
