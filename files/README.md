To access the Colab notebooks of my microprojects:
* Navigate to one of the microproject folders.
* Download the Python notebook.
* Open using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or your preferred Jupyter notebook application (like VS Code).
* Run all the code cells.
* Repeat the process for the other microproject folder.

If you accessed the FIFA matches microproject:
* Navigate to section 2.6
* There, you will see a bar graph showing the total number of goals scored by each national team in FIFA history
* Navigate to section 3.3
* There, you will see a line graph showing the average number of goals scored per match throughout the FIFA World Cups.

If you accessed the AI scene recognition microproject:
* Navigate to part 5.2
* There, you will see my classifier identifying the last 20 frames in the frames file found in the microproject folder.
* Verify the identification of some frames in the data frame. For example, is frame 310 really 'office hour' (meaning that it shows two people in an office-like setting)?
