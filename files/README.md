To access the Colab notebooks of my microprojects:
* Navigate to one of the microproject folders.
* Download the Python notebook.
* Open using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or your preferred Jupyter notebook application (like VS Code).
* Run all the code cells.
* Repeat the process for the other microproject folder.
